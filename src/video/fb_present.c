/**
 * Show the guest framebuffer in a window.
 *
 * The title renders into its own framebuffer in guest RAM and tells the kernel
 * where it is through AvSetDisplayMode; on hardware the CRTC scans that memory
 * out. Nothing here scans anything out, so however much of the GPU is
 * implemented, none of it is observable. This is the other half: a window that
 * reads that memory and puts it on screen.
 *
 * Deliberately plain GDI rather than the D3D8 layer. The point is to display
 * whatever the guest actually wrote, so the fewer stages between guest memory
 * and the screen the better -- and it must keep working while the D3D8 layer
 * is busy with something else, such as the FMV player's own window.
 *
 * Off unless RECOMP_FB_WINDOW is set.
